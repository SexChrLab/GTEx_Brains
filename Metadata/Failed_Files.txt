This is a record of the samples that initially would not run with snakemake.
Some were removed from analysis because the fastq files were corrupted.
Some of them worked when I did quality control on them individually at the command line. 
These samples are listed in ALL_SAMPLES_GTEX_Brain_v1.8.config. 
The samples that did pass QC are listed in Quantification.config.json.

        --> Ran trimmomatic. It looks like both fastqc and trimmomatic worked fine.
